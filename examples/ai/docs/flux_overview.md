# Overview

Flux is a distributed workflow orchestration engine designed to build stateful and fault-tolerant workflows in Python. It provides a robust framework for creating, managing, and executing complex workflows with built-in support for error handling, retries, and state management.

## What is Flux?

Flux is a Python-based workflow orchestration system that allows you to:
- Define workflows as Python code using decorators
- Break down complex processes into manageable tasks
- Handle failures and retries automatically
- Maintain state across workflow executions
- Scale from local development to distributed systems
