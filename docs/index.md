# Welcome to Flux

Welcome to **Flux**, a distributed workflow orchestration engine designed to make building stateful and fault-tolerant workflows in Python simple, intuitive, and powerful.

## What is Flux?

Flux is a Python-based workflow orchestration system that enables you to build complex, reliable applications by breaking them down into manageable tasks and workflows. Whether you're processing data pipelines, orchestrating microservices, automating business processes, or building machine learning workflows, Flux provides the tools and infrastructure you need to create robust, scalable solutions.

At its core, Flux transforms the way you think about building distributed applications by providing:

- **Intuitive Python Programming Model**: Define workflows using familiar Python async/await syntax with decorators
- **Built-in Reliability**: Automatic state persistence, error handling, and recovery mechanisms
- **Flexible Execution Models**: Run workflows locally during development or distribute them across multiple workers in production
- **Comprehensive State Management**: Full visibility and control over workflow execution with pause/resume capabilities

## Our Vision

We believe that building distributed applications shouldn't require mastering complex frameworks or sacrificing code clarity. Flux was created with the vision of making workflow orchestration as natural as writing regular Python code, while providing enterprise-grade reliability and scalability underneath.

Our goal is to enable developers to:
- **Focus on Business Logic**: Spend time solving domain problems, not infrastructure challenges
- **Build with Confidence**: Trust that your workflows will handle failures gracefully and maintain consistency
- **Scale Effortlessly**: Go from prototype to production without rewriting your core logic
- **Debug Effectively**: Understand exactly what happened during workflow execution with comprehensive state tracking
